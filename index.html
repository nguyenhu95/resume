    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
        A motivated, enthusiastic, and ambitious individual with a strong background in IT Support and a focus on Network Systems and Cybersecurity in education.
        Leveraging my experience and skill set, my career aspiration is to transition into a role as a Network Engineer,
        where I aim to incorporate advanced techniques such as Network Automation and Infrastructure as Code to optimize network operations and enhance efficiency.
    </p>
        <p>I have a diverse range of experience with multiple systems, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating Systems: Windows (7, 10, 11), Ubuntu</li>
            <li>Server Platforms: Windows Server, Microsoft Azure, VMware</li>
            <li>Networking Technologies: Cisco Meraki, LAN, WAN, TCP/IP, routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP)</li>
            <li>Collaboration Tools: Microsoft Office 365, Exchange, Active Directory</li>
            <li>Hardware: routers, switches, NAS devices</li>
            <li>Virtualization: VMware Hypervisor (vSphere)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        I spend a lot of my free time with my computer and homelab setup. Currently, my setup includes a server rack housing a NAS and a workstation running Proxmox.
        This setup provides me with a practical platform for learning and practicing CCNA and CCNP labs, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
        Additionally, I utilize it to self-host my own entertainment center, offering film and music streaming services.
